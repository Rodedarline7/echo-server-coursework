# Echo Server Coursework - Rodaline

This repository contains my coursework for the Echo Server assignment. It demonstrates client-server communication using Java sockets, with each client handled in a separate thread.

- `EchoServer.java` – Multi-threaded server implementation  
- `EchoClient.java` – Client code for testing server communication  
- `Coursework_Documentation.docx` – Word document with explanations, screenshots, and APA references  
- `index.html` – Web page for GitHub Pages hosting  
- `screenshots/` – Folder containing execution screenshots (`Picture1.png`, `Picture2.png`)   

**Compile the Java files**:
javac EchoServer.java 
javac EchoClient.java

**Start the server**:
java EchoServer


**Run the client in a separate terminal**:
java EchoClient

**Expected Output**:
- Server displays connection and received message  
- Client prints echoed message from server
